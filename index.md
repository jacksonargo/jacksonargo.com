### Bio

I am Alexander Jackson Argo: Linux technician, administrator, and enthusiast.

As a child I loved to take apart and study anything I could get my hands on: toys, car parts, old phones, computers, and so forth. I tried to learn how each piece was related and why they were assembled in a specific way. I even tried building new and better things out of the various parts and pieces that I collected.

I still love taking things apart, examining the pieces, and putting them back together in new and better ways. Today, the things that I take apart are more sophisticated than toys and old phones: computer hardware and software, administrative procedures, mathematical equations and algorithms, and even philosophical arguments. In the professional world, this means:

Finding the best possible configuration for ground-up computer network installation.
Creating fast and efficient software and procedures to maintain existing installations.
Rebuilding and reorganizing deficient systems to increase overall performance and productivity.

My personal goal is to ensure that the most secure, stable, and cutting edge technology is used in everything that I build and maintain, computer systems or otherwise.
